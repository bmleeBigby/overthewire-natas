# What's the difference between wargames and CTFs ?

CTFs are time limited hacking competitions. There are two types: Jeopardy, where there's a list of hacking challenges to solve. And Attack-Defense where every team hosts an identical server with vulnerable services, the goal is to find those vulnerabilities, close them in your own server and exploit them in the other oder team's servers.

Wargames are not time limited, nor really competitive. The same jeopardy type of challenges exist, and also a mode where you have to solve a challenge (level) to be able to progress to the next one.
